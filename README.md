#abstract
With the widespread use of wireless communication technologies and smart mobile terminals, Location Based Services (LBS) are becoming 
more and more popular. In many spatio-temporal crowdsourcing applications, participants receive corresponding rewards by submitting 
their own sensing tasks to crowdsourcing application servers. However, the submitted sensing data contains the participants' 
spatio-temporal data.
